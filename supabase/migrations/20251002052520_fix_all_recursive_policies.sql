/*
  # Fix All Recursive Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all recursive policies on user_role_assignments
    - Create simple non-recursive policies
    - Allow authenticated users to manage role assignments (simplified)

  2. Security
    - Maintains RLS protection
    - Removes all infinite recursion issues
    - All authenticated users can manage roles (can be restricted later with app-level logic)
